title: Intro to Infectious Disease Modelling
---

### Lecture Overview

This lecture introduces participants to the theory and philosophy behind
modelling infectious diseases, focussing on compartmental models, and especially
the SIR model and its extensions (SEIR, SEIRV), and developing an understanding
of the derivation and interpretation of the basic reproduction number, $R0$.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have a basic understanding of calculus and differential
equations, as well as some familiarity with the R programming language.

## Course Materials

- Lecture slides
- Code templates for exercises (R)
- Recommended readings and resources list

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of infectious disease modelling.
- Implement and analyse compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, and SEIRV models).
- Interpret model parameters and outputs.
- Derive/calculate and interpret the basic reproduction number (R0).
- Assess model assumptions and limitations.
